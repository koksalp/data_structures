# Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in **C programming language**. It includes fundamental data structures along with their standard operations, suitable for both learning, practicing and development purposes.

## Introduction

This repository includes some of the personal work done during my university course data structures (BLG223E). While it provides a solid foundation for understanding data structures, some functionalities may be inefficient due to learning purposes and the lack of time to fully optimize them. It might also be a great resource for those who struggle with grasping the idea of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and working with them. It's an excellent starting point for understanding core concepts, though performance improvements could be made in certain areas.

## Data Structures Implemented

The following data structures are implemented:

- **Linked List**
  - Singly Linked List
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees**
  - Binary Search Trees (BST)
- **Graphs** (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)

Each data structure comes with standard operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching. The implementations are designed to be efficient and straightforward.
